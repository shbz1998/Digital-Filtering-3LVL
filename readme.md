# Sum of Products  
## Shahbaz Hassan Khan Malik

This is a sum of products circuit, which is a method of digital filtering. It is one of many hardware algorithms for this function.  

1. It is a three-level hierachy circuit. 
2. Data paths are scalable. 
3. The default value for both the coefficient (Cx) and Data In widths is four 
bits. 
4. Coefficients as well as Data_In are primary system inputs. 
5. The second level consists of one instance of an adder, two instances of multipliers and two 
instances of registers.  
6. The top design level has two instances of the second level and one more adder.
